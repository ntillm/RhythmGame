## ðŸ§© Project Outline

**Title**: *RhythmTap: Arduino-Enhanced Rhythm Game*

**Description**:  
A musical rhythm game built in `p5.js` where players hit notes using the keyboard or an Arduino controller in sync with the music. The game challenges your timing and coordination while providing real-time feedback through visuals and sound.

## ðŸŽ® Narrative Description

**Overview**:  
The goal of *RhythmTap* is to hit notes as they fall toward a target zone, in time with a backing track. Players can use the spacebar, shift key, or a physical Arduino tap sensor to interact with the game. As notes fall, players must tap the corresponding input when they reach the hit zone. The game uses `p5.js` for rendering and user interaction, `Tone.js` for audio sequencing, and `p5.serialport` to connect to an Arduino device.

**Core Features**:
- Real-time MIDI-style note generation and beat sync  
- Three input types: keyboard (space/shift) and Arduino tap  
- Live scoring, combo system, and lives counter  
- Game states: start, active play, and game over  
- Uses synthesizers and samples for audio feedback
